# SpringDependencyInjection

The project consists of demo implementation of Spring dependency injection, Spring dependency injections are implemented using Setters and Constructors. In the demo, I have used setters dependency injection in example package and constructor dependency injection in ci package. The xml files of both the packages are config.xml (setter) and ciconfig.xml (constructor). I have created a resources directory as Spring identifies the path for xml by resources directory.

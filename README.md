# javaBeans

The project consists of demo implementation of beans, beans are implemented using Setters and Constructors in Spring. In the demo, I have used setters beans in
example package and constructor beans in ci package. The xml files of both the packages are config.xml (setter) and ciconfig.xml (constructor). I have created a
resources directory as Spring identifies the path for xml by resources directory.
